# leaflet-challenge


Welcome to my submission for the Leaflet Challenge in module 15 of the Data Analytics bootcamp. This project was completed as part of the curriculum to showcase my proficiency in basic JavaScript Mapping using libraries such as D3 and Leaflet plugins.


# Challenge Description
For this assignment, we were tasked with developing a visualization tool for earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). It involved fetching earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON feed, plotting the earthquakes on a Leaflet map, where marker size represents magnitude and color indicates depth, and creating a legend for contextual information.

# Resources Used

Challenges I drew heavily from include the following:
 - The Student City Markers Exercise
 - The Student Country GDP Exercise
 - The Layer Group Exercise
 - The Student GeoJson Exercise
 - The Student Marker Cluster Exercise




These challenges, in addition to the other challenges provided, helped teach us the following:
- How to create a map object
- How to implement map controls
- How to connect to the leaflet library
- How create a map legend
